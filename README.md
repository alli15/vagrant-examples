# stellar vagrant examples

## Usage

Each directory contains a Vagrantfile that describes a particular scenario. More will develop over time but here's one to get things started.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/vagrant-examples
cd vagrant-examples/single-peer
vagrant up
```

This will stand up a single peer that trusts the SDF testnet nodes.
